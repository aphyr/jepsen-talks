## Schism

I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication

I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing

## Call me maybe

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me I'll never tell

Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
So call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall

Before you came into my life I missed you so bad

## Somebody that I used to know

You didn't have to cut me off
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

## Single Ladies

## She's gone

She's gone, oh I, what went wrong

## 2 of Amerikaz most wanted

"You happy to see me?"

## Kylie Minogue

"Leave you move on to a perfect stranger"

## Last Friday Night

"Think we kissed but I forgot"

## Since you been gone

## Telephone

And now you won't stop calling me / I'm kinda busy

## Torn

There's nothing where he used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

## Cut my life into pieces

## Hakuna Matata

## All of the lights

## Queen

Caught in a netsplit
No objective reality

## Irreplaceable

You must not know bout P(RW)
